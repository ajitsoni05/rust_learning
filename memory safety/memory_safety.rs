fn main(){


  /*
    let enigma: i32;

    println!("{}",enigma);

    
    It is not allowed to use or capture an uninitialized variable.

    Erroneous code example:

    fn main() {
        let x: i32;
        let y = x; // error, use of possibly-uninitialized variable
    }

    To fix this, ensure that any declared variables are initialized before being used. Example:

    fn main() {
        let x: i32 = 0;
        let y = x; // ok!
    }
 */

 /*

    For the same reasons as above, conditional initialization is also not allowed
    since there is a case that when if condition is false then "enigma" will remain uninitialized.

  let enigma: i32;
    if true {
        enigma =1;
    }
    println!("{}",enigma);
